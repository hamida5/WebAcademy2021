<p> This project has helped me learn the web development elements better and also learn how to work with my peers. For this project we had to incorporate different elements from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We learned how to create a image rollover. The easiest part of the project for me was the CSS parts and styling parts. It was fun to add my own touch to the website. The hardest part for me was figuring out how the rollover image effect worked. I had lots of errors in my code in the beginning so the effect didn't work. It took a long time to find those mistakes and also fix them. I think next time I want to use my time better. I feel like I focused on certain parts too much, so I ran out of time to do the others. Next time I would like to use my time more efficently. My favorite part of the project is the style and CSS. Overall, I am very proud of our work.</p>

  <p>My experience with the rollover project has helped me develop my understanding of JavaScript and how it can be used for different features in a document. We were able to use our prior knowledge of CSS and HTML in order to form a document and review the previous content of labs and projects. Working with another person, I believe I was able to improve by observing how others were able to understand and communicate what they were able to get out of what we have learned so far in this class. This has helped me to further progress with the material and requirements of web design and development.</p>
