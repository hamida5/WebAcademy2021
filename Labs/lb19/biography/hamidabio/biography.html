  <h1>who am i?</h1>
  <p>My name is Hamida Tania. I am a tenth grader at Thomas A. Edison. I am a 15-year-old. I am a student, a sister to 2, a daughter, and a friend. I am an aries and a rising libra. I am a lover of spicy and savory food and a lover of music. I have a passion for reading and learning about real life mysteries. I am someone who isn't certain about what the future will be. But I am someone who hopes that I can be successful and happy in the future. </p>

  <div class="p2">
<h1>my future...</h1>
  <p>In the future, my main goal is to become successful, while still being happy. In terms of career, I would like to see myself as a pharmasict or anything related to the medical field. Working in the medical field is very hard but it also holds a lot of prestige. I also want to be very finically stable later on. I hope to own a big house and also buy a house for my parents. I would love to decorate my own house based off my style and opinion. It would be very nice to start my own family in a nice, big house. I also hope that I have enough money to retire young. I want travel around the world with my family. I want to visit places like Paris, New Zealand, Bora Bora, Rome, and London and try different foods. I also want to have a cat in the future. I have always wanted a cat ever since I was young but I was never allowed to because my mom doesn't like cats. When I am independant and move out, I hope that I can raise my own cat. Overall, I want my life to be balanced in the future. I want to be healthy, happy, and living my best life. </p>
